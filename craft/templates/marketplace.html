	 		<p>Before being event organizers and West Coast Swing promoters, we were (and still are) dancers. As dancers we found it hard to find and purchase dance wear. We struggled to find the right pair of dancing shoes &amp; clothing to complement us on the dancefloor. We thought of many ways to make this endeavour easier for us and for you, so the Marketplace is the best idea we had so far.</p>

			<h2>So what is this Marketplace about?</h2>
			
			<h3>Dancers</h3>
			<p>First of all, it's about you, the dancer! If you want to get that new pair of shoes or cool shirts and accessories, you will have the chance to browse through the available items.</p>
			
			<h3>Creatives</h3>
			<p>Second of all, it's about you, the creative soul! If you personalize or distribute dancing shoes, clothing or accessories make the most of this opportunity and show them all off. Bring your stuff and we will make sure that you have a reserved spot to advertise &amp; sell it.</p>
			
			<p>There are no costs involved, we want you to keep all the profits. Please contact us as soon as you decide to participate in the marketplace, so that we can take care of the organisational aspects.</p>
			
			<h3>Manufacturers</h3>

			<p>And last but not least, it's about them, our local manufacturers &amp; partners. They all make our lives as dancers much easier and we feel that it is our responsibility to help them get to know you and your needs. Below you can find a list of partners who already confirmed their attendance to the Citadel Swing Marketplace.</p>

			<p><strong>The Marketplace will be held on Sunday from 16:30 until 18:30</strong>. See you there!</p>
